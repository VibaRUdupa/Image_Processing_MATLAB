# Image_Processing_MATLAB
MATLAB scripts for basic image processing.

This file contains Logic of every script.
This repo will contain fully documented MATLAB scripts that are done with the help of image processing toolkit. 
It is advisable to go through MATLAB image processing toolkit's documentation for syntax related issues.
Note: As new scripts are updated, this README.md file will be updated.

### 1. Measure from image

  The first script added allows user to measure the diameter of the object in an image in "pixels".
  
  The script and techniques employed are specified in the folder Measure_with_image(https://github.com/VibaRUdupa/Image_Processing_MATLAB/tree/master/Measure_from_image) 
  with the title "README.md" (https://github.com/VibaRUdupa/Image_Processing_MATLAB/blob/master/Measure_from_image/README.md).
 
##### FINAL OUTPUT:
  
  <img src = "https://github.com/VibaRUdupa/Image_Processing_MATLAB/blob/master/Image_for_linking/figure%204.PNG" height = "500" width = "500" >
  
  
  
### 2. Automatic Number Plate Recognition

The second script added automatically detects the registration number of the car passing by the camera placed at correct location. 

The script and techniques employed are specified in the folder Automatic_Number_plate_recognition(https://github.com/VibaRUdupa/Image_Processing_MATLAB/tree/master/Automatic_Number_Plate_Recognition) with the title "README.md"(https://github.com/VibaRUdupa/Image_Processing_MATLAB/blob/master/Automatic_Number_Plate_Recognition/README.md).

##### FINAL OUTPUT:

<img src = "https://github.com/VibaRUdupa/Image_Processing_MATLAB/blob/master/Image_for_linking/apn_fig9.PNG" height = "500" width = "600" >
